<h1><strong>Welcome!</strong></h1>
<p>This dashboard is an experimental prototype designed to explore ways the Metadata Services Unit (MSU) can share data related to metadata production and quality.</p>

<h5><strong>What data can I see?</strong></h5>
<p> Currently, the available data sets feature:
<ul>
    <li>Metadata production (<em>Approvals</em> -- including AMI approvals) for July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2019 (aka fiscal year 2019)</li>
	<li>Metadata quality (<em>Overview of Scores, Scores by Element</em>) for March 2019 and June 2019</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h5><strong>Is the data live?</strong></h5>
<p> No. The data is static. </p>

<h5><strong>How is this interactive?</strong></h5>
<p>Use the menu in the left-hand navigation to view data. Select <i class="fas fa-caret-square-down"></i> a research library division from the dropdown menu on the left to view data for one division, or select All Divisions. This will change the summary information at the top of each page (<em>including this page</em>) as well as the data visualization.</p>

<h5><strong>This is pretty neat. What if there is other data or ways of looking at data that would be helpful to me?</strong></h5>
<p>We want to share data that is informative and useful. We also want to facilitate a positive user experience. And so, we welcome your feedback to help build better MSU reporting. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Consider this a starting point that will evolve based on collective input from across the research library divisions. Let us know what's helpful, what's not, and what you'd like to see here that would be of greatest interest and/or use for your division. <a href="mailto:sararubinow@nypl.org?Subject=MSU%20Dashboard%20feedback" target="_top">Email us</a> with your feedback.</p>
