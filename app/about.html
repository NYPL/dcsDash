<h2><b>Welcome!</b></h2>
<p>This dashboard is a prototype designed to explore ways the Metadata Services Unit (MSU) can share data related to metadata production and quality.</p>
<p>
<h4><b>What's new?</b></h4>
<p> <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
		<li>A foray into visualizing connections between metadata production and digital imaging. Check out "MSU/DIU in context" under <em>Metadata production</em> to see the relationships between metadata creation, the addition of digital images to the repository, and metadata approvals. You'll also be able to view the top collections contributing to the statistics for each month.</li>
		<li>Improved research library division selection: it's now easier to select a research center, multiple research divisions, all divisions, or a single division</li>
	</ul>
<p>
<h4><b>Is the data live?</b></h4>
<p> No. The data is static.</p>
<p>
<h4><b>This is pretty neat. What if there is other data or ways of looking at data that would be helpful to me?</b></h4>
<p>We welcome your input to help build better MSU reporting. In fact, many of the the key updates noted above are in direct response to your feedback! </p>
<p>
<p>Consider this a work-in-progress that will continue to evolve. Let us know what's helpful, what's not, and what you'd like to see here that would be of greatest interest and/or use for you. <a href="mailto:sararubinow@nypl.org?Subject=MSU%20Dashboard%20feedback" target="_top">Email us</a> with your feedback.</p>
