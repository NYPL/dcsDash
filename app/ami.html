<h5><strong>About AMI approvals</strong></h5>
<p>Metadata is approved when it meets our metadata standards. MSU staff are the only ones in the Library who have this responsibility. Audio and moving image (AMI) approvals only refer to items with the resource type sound recording or moving image. </p>

<h5><strong>Items vs digital assets</strong></h5>
<p>A single item represents multiple digitized assets (known as captures). For example, a video of a dance performance (one item) may have been recorded on multiple cassettes (many captures).</p>
  
<h5><strong>Why is this important?</strong></h5>
<p>When an AMI item record is approved and has a public-facing rights profile, it appears on Digital Collections for anyone with an internet connection.</p>
<p>When an AMI item is approved and has an on-premises-only rights profile restricted to a specific research library location, it is available on Digital Collections via any hardwired computer at that location (as well as at the Library Services Center). The material is also searchable on Digital Collections from anywhere in the world, but only playable at the specified location. </p>
