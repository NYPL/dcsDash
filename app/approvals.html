<h5><strong>About approvals</strong></h5>
<p>Metadata is approved when it meets our metadata standards. MSU staff are the only ones in the Library who have this responsibility. The approvals here reflect all resource types, including text, still image, cartographic, notated music, and audio/moving image materials.</p>

<h5><strong>Items vs digital assets</strong></h5>
<p>A single item record often represents multiple digitized assets (known as captures). For example, a fully-digitized book (one item) could have hundreds of pages (many captures).</p>
  
<h5><strong>Why is this important?</strong></h5>
<p>When an item record is approved and has a public-facing rights profile, it appears on Digital Collections for anyone with an internet connection.</p>
<p>
<p>When an item is approved and has an on-premises-only rights profile, it is available on Digital Collections via any hardwired computer across all branch and research library locations. </p>
