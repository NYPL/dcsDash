<h5><strong>Metadata quality comparison</strong></h5>
<p>We assessed the six metadata elements above required for the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WkzQcf5UBcGTOLJGpCDEfxfLAxhZP6-W-IrgvTIRjO0">minimum viable description</a> of digitized items. This view compares scores between the end of March 2019 and the end of June 2019.
<ul style="list-style: none;">
	<li><span style="color:#91cf60"><strong>Green</strong></span> is a passing score</li>
	<li><span style="color:#fee08b"><strong>Yellow</strong></span> is a partial score  (i.e. some but not all of the quality criteria were met)</li>
	<li><span style="color:#fc8d59"><strong>Orange</strong></span> is a failing score (i.e. the element is not present at the item-level)</li></ul>
</p>
  
<h5><strong>Why is this important?</strong></h5>
<p>This information provides a more granular analysis to help us strategize and track targeted remediation projects. Improving metadata quality improves discovery of and context for our online collections.</p>
