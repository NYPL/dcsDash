<h5><b>Metadata and digital imaging in context</b></h5>
<p>To better understand metadata activities within the digitization process, it's helpful to include data points related to the addition of digital assets to the repository. In this case, we're looking specifically at photographed assets added by the Digital Imaging Unit (DIU). These images are either photographed in-house or by a vendor.</p>

<h5><b>Metadata creation</b></h5>
<p>Digital images are attached to metadata records in the repository, so metadata records creation precedes digital photography. Sometimes by a matter of days for a rush request. Sometimes by a matter of months or even years for a large digitization project.</p>
  
<h5><b>Why is this important?</b></h5>
<p>Reviewing metadata activities in relation to the activities of other units creates context that can help shed light on the work of the MSU as well as the larger digitization lifecycle.</p>
