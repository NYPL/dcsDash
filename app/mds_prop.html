<h5><strong>Metadata quality assessment</strong></h5>
<p>We assessed six metadata elements required for the <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WkzQcf5UBcGTOLJGpCDEfxfLAxhZP6-W-IrgvTIRjO0">minimum viable description</a> of digitized items. This page shows a summary of item scores in each division and research center.</p> <!-- <a href="#shiny-tab-faq" data-toggle="tab">Click here</a> for a key to division abbreviations.</p> -->

<h5><strong>What do we mean by metadata quality?</strong></h5>
<p>We are currently looking at three metadata quality criteria:
<ul style="list-style: none;"><li><em>Completeness</em>: Is the element or attribute present?</li>
<li><em>Accessibility</em>: Can it be understood by a human and/or a machine?</li>
<li><em>Conformance</em>: Does it meet core needs of our user community by conforming to expected standards?</li></ul>
</p>
  
<h5><strong>Why is this important?</strong></h5>
<p>This work identifes the frequency and distribution of our most common metadata errors and provide opportunities for enhancement to help us strategize remediation projects. Improving metadata quality improves discovery of and context for our online collections.</p>
