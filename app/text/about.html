<h3><b>Welcome to the NYPL Digital Collections Services dashboard.</b></h3>
<p>Here you'll find the most current data related to the cross-departmental collaborative effort to provide access to the Library’s Digital Collections.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><b>Who is this for?</b></h4>
<p>This dashboard is primarily designed to help inform internal stakeholders about the production activities related to digitization and publishing on NYPL’s Digital Collections. In addition, our hope is that this dashboard will also provide a useful point of reference for the digitization efforts of other research institutions to illuminate common strengths and challenges.</p>
<h4><b>What can I learn here?</b></h4>
<p> <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
		<li>The percentage of digitized items and digital assets (aka captures) that are published to our Digital Collections.</li>
		<li>The Publishing Timeline shows when each item or capture was published to Digital Collections.</li>
		<li>The Project Lifecycle provides a view into each stage in the lifecycle of a digitization project over time.</li>
		<li>Department-specific information related to Metadata and Rights.</li>
		<li>AMI Preservation work is represented by the date when a package of assets related to an object has passed quality control and is ready for ingest into the repository and the date when these assets have been ingested.</li>
	</ul>
<p></p>
<h4><b>What's next?</b></h4>
<p>In the future, look for more robust project lifecycle data for the digitization of audio and moving image materials at NYPL.</p>
