<h5><strong>What do we mean by metadata quality?</strong></h5>
<p>We are currently looking at the following metadata quality criteria:
<ul style="list-style: none;"><li><em>Completeness</em>: Is the element or attribute present?</li>
<li><em>Accessibility</em>: Can it be understood by a human and/or a machine?</li>
<li><em>Conformance</em>: Does it meet core needs of our user community by conforming to expected standards?</li>
<li><em>Accuracy</em>: Is the element or attribute accurate?</li></ul>
</p>
  
<h5><strong>Why is this important?</strong></h5>
<p>This work identifies the frequency and distribution of our most common metadata errors and provides opportunities for enhancement to help the MSU strategize remediation projects. Improving metadata quality improves discovery of and context for our online collections.</p>
