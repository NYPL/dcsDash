<i>This project grew from Research Library staff interest in work suitable for telecommuting and involves the collaboration of both curatorial and non-curatorial staff.</i>

<h5><strong>About this project:</strong></h5>
<p>The Name element remediation project focuses on ensuring that name roles and authorized headings are present and conform to our standards. The presence of this information helps patrons better understand objects in our Digital Collections.</p>

<h5><strong>About the Name element:</strong></h5>
<p>The Name element contains information about a person or an organization contributing to the creation or production of the resource. This element is recommended but not mandatory.</p>
  
<h5><strong>Why is this important?</strong></h5>
<p>The role specified in each Name element (e.g., Author, Engraver, Performer) identifies the relationship between the named entity and the resource, providing key contextual information. By using human- and machine-readable data from an authority file, such as the Library of Congress Name Authority File, we create the foundation for linking our objects to other collections or pulling additional information from external sources into the Digital Collections display.</p>
