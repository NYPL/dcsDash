<h5><b>Audio and moving image (AMI) digitization</b></h5>
<p>Digitization of media is used as a preservation strategy as much as to increase use and reuse. To further complicate matters, media often is not precisely labelled, requiring digitization to occur before curatorial or processing staff may review and identify the recordings. Extensive post-digitization work may be necessary by cataloging, archival processing, metadata, rights, and collection staff before assets may be published on the Library's public platforms.</p>

<h5><b>Dates</b></h5>
<p>Dates associated with AMI assets reflect project management workflows, rather than production patterns or capacity. In most cases, "date reported" indicates when a package of assets related to an object has passed quality control and is ready for ingest into the repository. Occasionally, it is an educated guess to match transcoded files to legacy projects; if legacy projects cannot be identified, the date of file creation is used.</p>
