<h5><strong>Extended metadata quality assessment for recommended elements</strong></h5>
<p>Building on our foundational minimum mandatory work, the MSU assessed seven recommended metadata elements for compliance with our metadata criteria. 
<ul style="list-style: none;">
	<li><span style="color:#91cf60"><strong>Green</strong></span> is a passing score</li>
	<li><span style="color:#fee08b"><strong>Yellow</strong></span> is a partial score  (i.e. some but not all of the quality criteria were met)</li>
	<li><span style="color:#fc8d59"><strong>Orange</strong></span> is a failing score (i.e. none of the quality criteria were met)</li></ul>
</p>
  
<h5><strong>What do we mean by metadata quality?</strong></h5>
<p>Our recommended mandatory element assessment encompasses the following metadata quality criteria:
<ul style="list-style: none;"><li><em>Completeness</em>: Is the element or attribute present?</li>
<li><em>Accessibility</em>: Can it be understood by a human and/or a machine?</li>
<li><em>Conformance</em>: Does it meet core needs of our user community by conforming to expected standards?</li></ul>
</p>

<h5><strong>Why is this important?</strong></h5>
<p>This information provides a more granular analysis to help the MSU strategize and track targeted remediation projects. Improving metadata quality improves discovery of and context for our online collections.</p>
