<i>MSU organized this project for Preservation of Audio and Moving Image (PAMI) staff interest in work suitable for telecommuting.</i>

<h5><strong>About this project:</strong></h5>
<p>The Type of Resource element remediation project focuses on correcting issues of accuracy that arose when data was migrated to MMS for its launch in 2012. The migration generated erroneous “still image” resource types for material that is accurately described using other/additional resource types. You can observe this disparity and track project progress over time in the chart above.</p>

<h5><strong>About the Type of Resource element:</strong></h5>
<p>Type of Resource is a minimum mandatory metadata element that expresses the general type and characteristics of the original resource content.</p>
  
<h5><strong>Why is Type of Resource accuracy important?</strong></h5>
<p>The Type of Resource element allows users to facet result sets by general type and can help applications determine the appropriate viewing or playback system. It also helps stakeholders understand—at a high level—what resource types are available in our digital collections.</p>
